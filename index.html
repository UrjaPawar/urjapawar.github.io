            Hi! I am Urja Pawar from India. Right now a Ph.D. Scholar in the domain of AI. I am currently in Ireland for my studies. Before this, I have done my B.Tech from NIT Raipur, India, and worked as a Software Engineer in Optum for more than a year. I absolutely love Software Engineering and aspire to become a good technical leader in the industry. Other than this, I am an excellent cook (Indian dishes, of course) and dancer. I am not a fan of movies and series but sometimes enjoy content from comedy genre.
        </p>

        <p>
            I tried indulging myself in various career options and have found roles related to software/hardware architectural decision making to be extremely inspiring. I believe Software Engineering is the pillar over which many more advancements will be brought and I enjoy being a part of it. I, very early on have started to believe in a 9-5 job, hanging out with colleagues, working on an assigned project as if it's my own, and enjoying carefree weekends. Although my belief might change after a while, for now, I will be happy with a challenging role assigned.
        </p>

            Cheers,
            <br>
