        <h1>Wowmen</h1>

        <time datetime="26-03-2019">March. 26, 2020</time>

        <p>
            Ever noticed that girl whose notes were distributed to the whole class? That girl who used to leave early from the office parties? The one who is always afraid to ask for the silliest of favours?
        </p>

        <p>
            Since a very long time, we have been portraying an ideal woman as someone subtle, shy, kind and gentle nature. One who is responsible for the integrity of a family, one who will always shower unconditional love upon her closed ones. As the days are passing, we are seeing women redefining themselves by not limiting their knowledge and power to homes and by exploring the world out of the established boundaries to connect, to challenge and to inspire.
        </p>

        <p>
            We may feel that she knows a little but when we are guiding her, she actually keeps her conscience along and trust her instincts without letting the world know about her wisdom. We may feel that she needs to be protected but when she faces any danger alone, she amazes the whole world by unveiling her heroic avatar. We may also feel that she can‚Äôt manage being both a housewife and a business woman but when she takes the shot, the whole world gets awestruck by her talent and audacity.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The best part is, she doesn‚Äôt show off. She doesn‚Äôt need to. She believes in sharing love without expectations. She believes in consistent actions without taking care of the results. She is someone who has been gifted an enormous will power to love in times of pain and to work in times of crisis.
        </p>

        <p>
            But hey! That‚Äôs not all! She isn‚Äôt that boring too! üòâ
        </p>

        <blockquote style="border-left: 8px solid #ffbf00;">
            ‚ÄúWhatever you give a woman, she will make greater. If you give her sperm, she'll give you a baby.. If you give her a house, she'll give you a home. If you give her groceries, she'll give you a meal. If you give her a smile, she'll give you her heart. She multiplies and enlarges what is given to her. So, if you give her any crap, be ready to receive a ton of shit!‚Äù
            -- Erick S. Gray

        <p>
            She knows how to crazily dance in celebrations. She knows how to outsmart wittiest of the witty men in dating. She knows how to make people stare in awe when she enters a hall with that pretty dress glorified with her smile. She has handled the toughest times of her best friends and has made the time tough for her haters. She has everything she wants, even if she doesn‚Äôt, she does has the skill and tenacity to acquire it.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, the next time you encounter that girl in the bar, that lady in your office, your mother, sister, daughter or wife, adore her! Keep her happy! She is the purest form of God in this world.
